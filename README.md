# Forensic DNA Analysis Tutorial

Author: Maria Joseph

This tutorial provides a hands-on introduction to forensic DNA analysis using bioinformatics tools and Python. It guides you through the process of analyzing DNA sequences from a simulated crime scene to identify potential suspects.

## Purpose

This tutorial is designed for beginners and those interested in learning how to apply bioinformatics to forensic science. By following this tutorial, you will gain practical experience in:

-   Loading and processing DNA sequences.
-   Analyzing and comparing DNA samples.
-   Generating reports and visualizations of DNA analysis results.

## Files Description

-   `crime_scene_dna.fasta`: A FASTA file containing DNA sequences from a simulated crime scene.
-   `simulated_crime_scene.py`: A Python script to generate the simulated crime scene DNA.
-   `load_sequences.py`: A Python script to load and process DNA sequences from FASTA files.
-   `analyze_results.py`: A Python script to analyze and compare DNA sequences.
-   `generate_report.py`: A Python script to generate a report of the DNA analysis results.
-   `graphs.py`: A Python script to generate visualizations of the DNA analysis results.
-   `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the tutorial.

## How to Use

1.  **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine.
2.  **Install Dependencies:** Ensure you have Python and the necessary libraries (e.g., Biopython) installed. Refer to the [Forensic DNA Analysis Using Bioinformatics: A Hands-On Introduction](YourManualLink.pdf) manual for detailed setup instructions.
3.  **Run the Scripts:**
    -   Place your suspect DNA FASTA files in the same directory.
    -   Run the scripts in the following order:
        1.  `load_sequences.py`
        2.  `analyze_results.py`
        3.  `generate_report.py`
        4.  `graphs.py`
4.  **View the Results:** The analysis results will be generated in the report and graphs.

## Example Usage

To analyze the provided `crime_scene_dna.fasta` file, simply run the scripts as described above.

## Troubleshooting

For detailed troubleshooting, please refer to the [Forensic DNA Analysis Using Bioinformatics: A Hands-On Introduction](YourManualLink.pdf) manual. Common issues include file path errors and missing dependencies.
